Bedrock is a code foundation primarily intended to rapidly build microservices using JSON for client interactions. Support code for working with those microservices in Java, Python, C#, and C++ is part of this foundation.

In Bedrock 2, All parameters are passed in the message body using POST for security, and GET type fetches are not supported at all.
